# This file tells cargo to use the lld linker, which is faster than the default one.
# If you are on Linux or macOS, you need to install lld separately.
# On Windows, it should be included with the Rust toolchain.

# On Linux, uncomment the following lines:
#[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
#linker = "clang"
#rustflags = ["-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# On macOS, uncomment the following lines:
#[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
#rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# On Windows, uncomment the following lines:
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
linker = "rust-lld.exe"
rustflags = [] # Removed "-Zshare-generics=y" as it requires nightly Rust

# Optional: Improve performance on Windows native builds.
# Requires the mold linker to be installed.
#[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
#linker = "mold"
#rustflags = ["-Zshare-generics=y", "-Clink-arg=--ld-path=mold"]
